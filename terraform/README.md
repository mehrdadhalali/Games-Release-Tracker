AWS_ACCESS_KEY = "XXXX"
AWS_SECRET_KEY = "XXXX"
DB_PASSWORD = "XXXX"
DB_USER = "XXXX"
DB_NAME="XXXX"
DB_PORT="XXXX"
DB_PORT_S="XXXX"
DB_HOST="XXXX"

SUBNET_NAME="XXXX"

EPIC_ECR="XXXX"
REPORT_ECR="XXXX"
tf_ECR="XXXX"
DASHBOARD_ECR="XXXX"

SNS_TOPIC_PREFIX="XXXX"

```

Before running this terraform script, you need to go into the [web_scraping](../web_scraping), [report](../report),[load_to_rds](../load_to_rds) and [dashboard](../dashboard) folders and follow the instructions for `Deploying to the Cloud`, which involves making the ECRs containing the Docker images. Once the ECR's have been created then the terraform can be run.
